<h1 style="margin-right:255px;">Project Description</h1>
<p>
Smeedee is a monitor that harvests key information from running software projects. Smeedee finds useful information in the Version Control System (source control), Continuous Integration system (build servers), source code itself and in the project management tool you are using. The key information is interpreted and then visualized on a digital Dashboard. 
</p>

<p>So instead of working in an information centric environment, were you have to find and interpret the data yourself. Smeedee will find and interpret the data for you, and then push key information to you and the rest of the team.
</p>

<p>With Smeedee, you’ll experience a better flow of information in your team. The teamwork will become more transparent and you’ll have a superior tool for maximizing productivity and quality in software projects.

<h2>Features:</h2>
<p>Smeedee can inform you and your team about;</p>
<ul>
    <li>The latest changes in the source code</li>
    <li>When the build is broken</li>
    <li>How many actual working days there is left in the current iteration</li>
    <li>The overall activity in the project</li>
    <li>The performance of your team (Sprint burndown)</li>
    <li>What you have agreed upon in the last Sprint retrospective</li>
</ul> 
<p>
    The best part is that Smeedee will give your team this information without them having to 
    ask for it.  When Smeedee is installed in the office landscape where your team works, 
    it radiates out information to your team while they are working or when they walk by. 
    It shows information that your team care about. (need more work)
