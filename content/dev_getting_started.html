<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>
Our Getting Started guide is written with the aim to help new developers to quickly get started contributing through Smeedee development.
</p>

<h3>1. Set up your development environment</h3>
<p>
See <a href="doc_dev_tools.html">Development tools</a> for a list of what you
need.
</p>

<h3>2. Check out the source code</h3>
<p>
    We use SubVersion for Source Control Management. For Windows users a good
    client is TortoiseSVN, however, any client of your choice can be used.
</p>

<p>
    You can check out or Subversion repository from
    http://smeedee.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
</p>

<h4>3. Open the main solution</h4>
<p>
    In the checked out folder, you can find our project in the trunk/source
    folder. In this folder you will find the solution file Smeedee.sln which
    contains all the projects needed for Smeedee. Smeedee.Client.Web is the
    main entrance to the smeedee application and should be used as start up
    project.    
</p>

<h3>4. What you can expect to find in the solution</h3>
<p>
Smeedee's Visual Studio solution is segmented into the following parts:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Buildscripts</b> contains the scripts necessary to build Smeedee,
    run tests and generate setup kits.</li>
    <li><b>Client</b> contains client specific parts such as the client
    application itself and the different widgets, all enforcing the MVVM
    pattern.</li>
    <li><b>Common</b> contains common framework across the application such as
    settings and configuration.</li>
    <li><b>DomainModel</b> contains the domain concepts that Smeedee's
    different tasks and widgets are based on.</li>
    <li><b>Scheduler/Tasks</b> contains the different tasks that are run server side such
    as those used for gathering data from third party systems as well as the
    system for scheduling and dispatch these tasks.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Most parts consists of three projects:
<ul>
    <li>1 project for production code</li>
    <li>1 silverlight project for the view</li>
    <li>1 project with tests</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>5. Testing</h3>
<p>
    We are doing Test Driven Development (TDD) and strongly encourage you to do the
    same as this will help make sure the source code easier to maintain as well as
    minimizing technical debt and acting as documentation.
</p>
<p>
    We are also using TinyBDD - A behaviour driven development (BDD) DSL for C#
    which is also test runner agnostic and lets you do BDD syntax while writing
    tests.
