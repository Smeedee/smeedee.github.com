<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

<h2>Out of browser experience</h2>
<h3>Some of my widgets are missing.</h3>
<p>
    We have experienced some issues with newer versions of Windows not properly
    resolving localhost to 127.0.0.1. If you experience issues where only some
    of your installed widgets are loading, usually a random set each time you
    run Smeedee - you should try reinstalling the out of browser version from the
    browser version displayed when you connect to the server using a
    specific IP instead of hostname. (E.g. 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost)
</p>
<p>
    Alternatively you can set your hosts file to staticaly resolve localohost
    to 127.0.0.1. You can do this by editing
    C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts and adding a line "127.0.0.1
    localhost" to this file.
</p>

<h2>IIS Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>
The server part of Smeedee is hosted by IIS, and if it is not correctly configured, Smeedee won't work. You may see symptoms like no Admin Tasks, never-ending loading of slideshow configuration or just no Smeedee at all! Here is a list of things you can check to verify your IIS configuration.
</p>

<h3>App Pool .NET version</h3>

<p>Make sure that the application pool that the smeedee application runs in is set to use .NET 4.0.
<ol>
<li>Open the IIS Management Console</li>
<li>On the left hand side click Application Pools under the server node</li>
<li>Find the Smeedee App Pool and click Basic Settings</li>
<li>Confirm that the .NET Framework Version is set to 4.0</li>

</ol>
 </p>

<h3>ISAPI Filters for .NET 4.0</h3>

<p>Make sure that the ISAPI fileters for .NET 4.0 are added and enabled</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the IIS Management Console</li>
<li>Select Default Web Site under the server node</li>
<li>Double Click the icon with the name ISAPI FIlters. There should be two entries for .NET 4.0 like the image below
<img src="images/ISAPI_FiltersDialog.png" />
</li>
<li>If you are missing the .NET 4.0 entries you need to add the file C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\aspnet_filter.dll</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h3>ISAPI & CGI Restrictions</h3>

<p>Make sure that ISAPI and CGI is enabled</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the IIS Management Console</li>
<li>Select the server in the list on the left</li>
<li>Double click the icon with the text ISAPI and CGI Restrictions</li>
<li>Confirm that the .NET 4.0 ISAPI filters are set to "allowed"

</li>
</ol>
