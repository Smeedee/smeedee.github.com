<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

<h2>Out of browser experience</h2>
<h3>Some of my widgets are missing.</h3>
<p>
    We have experienced some issues with newer versions of Windows not properly
    resolving localhost to 127.0.0.1. If you experience issues where only some
    of your installed widgets are loading, usually a random set each time you
    run Smeedee - you should try reinstalling the out of browser version from the
    browser version displayed when you connect to the server using a
    specific IP instead of hostname. (E.g. 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost)
