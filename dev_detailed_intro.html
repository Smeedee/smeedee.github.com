<h1>Detailed introduction</h1>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>
    For a broader overview of the architecture take a look at 
    <a href="dev_architecture_overview.html">The architecture page</a>. What we
    want to focus on in this section is how the architecture relates to development
    practices and the other technologies in our project. Our hope is that new
    developers will meet less resistance when being integrated in the project if
    they have a greater understanding of where the different nuts and bolts fit in
    the ever growing system that is Smeedee.
</p>

<p>
    Smeedee's architecture is a fairly standard one and by no means an
    architecture to be intimidated by. There are clients, a server, a database
    and something that we have elected to call a Task Scheduler, which in
    essence is just a windows service that supplies runs different tasks at
    certain intervals, usually to supply the database with information. We'll
    start at the top (the client) and work our way down meanwhile trying to
    show how we in Smeedee do development on each each architectural element.
</p>

<h3>1.1 Client</h3>
<p>
    Development on a the client side is in most cases associated with our
    Widget concept, either doing maintenance on an existing one or making a
    brand new one from scratch. When doing this kind of work its important to
    keep in mind the pattern that we use as a template for all our Widgets,
    namely the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern. You can read more about
    MVVM in chapter 3.1.
</p>

<p>
    The client communicates with the server through web services and these
    should be, and for most existing services are, referenced in the
    Smeedee.Client.Framework.SL project (ref 5.2). You can use these references to
    make a "Repository" class which acts as a service wrapper and is also
    placed in the same Smeedee.Client.Framework project, more specifically in a
    folder conveniently marked Repositories. For fore information on the
    repository pattern see chapter 3.3. In a few cases there are, and needs to
    be, a handful of helper classes in some of the widget projects, but the
    rule of thumb is to extract all general concepts to our domain model and
    all general logic and service references to the framework projects. For
    more information and examples on this take a look at chapter 5. We have
    also made a short step by step walk-through for creating a new Widget and
    its affiliated classes from a Visual Studio environment which you'll find
    <a href="dev_widget_howto.html">here.</a>
    
</p>

<h3>1.2 Server</h3>
<p>
    The server's only job is to allow clients access to the database. This is
    done via web services. Creating a new server component is easy, all you
    have to do is:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Create a new service and corresponding test suite in server folder
    projects (ref 5.7).</li>
    <li>Add a reference to the service in the Smeedee.Client.Framework.SL
    project (ref 5.2).</li>
</ol>
<p>
    These are the main steps in essence. It's that easy! Now you're set to make
    a client widget that uses the new component like we discussed in part 1.1.
</p>

<h3>1.3 Database</h3>
<p>
    The Smeedee database is an SQLite database. This is a self-contained and
    serverless database consisting of a single file. Upon installation a file
    by the name of "smeedeeDB.db" will be copied to your %AppData% folder and
    it is this file which Smeedee uses to store and access data. The file can
    also be accessed by third-party applications such as SQLite Admin or
    similar.
</p>

<h3>1.4 Task Scheduler</h3>
<p>
    This is the nerve center of our integration process. As you might already
    have guessed, the Task Scheduler is responsible for running a number of
    tasks on the server, usually to collect and persist data. Persistence is
    done by way of NHibernate (Ref 4.1). Harvesters and other integration
    components are often placed in the "Integration" folder (Ref 5.6), however
    some tasks may be self contained.
</p>


<h2>2 Development methodology in Smeedee</h2>

<h3>2.1 Testdriven development in Smeedee</h3>
<p>
    In Smeedee we practice Test Driven Development (TDD), specifically the kind
    that is Behavior Driven. We currently operate with three different test
    syntaxes in our project. We have the classic NUnit syntax which in some
    cases has a BDD twist. In parallell with this we have the old and new
    TinyBDD syntax. This is mostly due to a rocky start standard-wise, but now
    we conform to the newest TinyBDD syntax and would appreciate that all
    contributors try to do this as well. Read more about TinyBDD and get syntax
    examples <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tinybdd/">at the TinyBDD project
        page</a>.
</p>

<h2>Development patterns and practices</h2>
<h3>3.1 Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern</h3>
<p>
    MVVM is short for Model-View-ViewModel. It is a pattern based on the MVC
    and MVP patterns. The basis of the pattern is basic MVC; you separate your
    code into a model, view and a controller. The new thing in MVVM compared to
    MVC is the ViewModel. This is a special model made only for the visual
    presentation, the view. This has very positive effect on the testability of
    your application.
</p>

<p>
    Say you have a Customer model. The customer has all the default boring
    properties like name and age and so on. In the system, you need to show or
    hide alcoholic beverages depending on the customer age. So, where do you
    put the logic? It is tempting to just put a condition in the view that sais
    if customer.Age is greater than 18 then show alcoholic beverages. This is the most
    basic trap, because you now have business logic in your GUI component.
    Great... The thing is that we do not want any logic in GUI components. They
    are very cumbersome to test, and chances are they just won't be tested. You
    can also remedy this situation by letting the controller set the visibility
    of alcohol beverages. Yay, then you don't have any logic in the GUI
    component! But there is a catch: You still need the GUI component when you
    test, and to verify the behavior of the controller, you will have to check
    the GUI component. Are the alcoholic beverages really hidden?
</p>

<p>
    Enter ViewModel. The ViewModel acts as a model for the View, hence
    ViewModel. In our case the ViewModel would have a property called
    IsAlcoholBeveragesVisible that is set by the controller. Using WPF
    databinding one can bind GUI element properties to this property of the
    ViewModel. The binding is defined in the XAML code of the View, and it
    works both ways. If the ViewModel changes a property the view will update,
    and if the user changes a property that is bound to the ViewModel it is
    updated. For example you can bind a textbox' text property to the FirstName
    property of your Customer. If the Text property of the textbox is changed
    it will updated the FirstName, and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
     This means that you can now test the workings of the controller, without
     ever dipping into the GUI part of the framework! Because all decisions
     made by the controller now results in a change in the ViewModel, and the
     ViewModel is just a plain .NET object, we can easilly test the behavior
     of the controller. The MVVM pattern is used together with the Commands
     pattern to provide a way to invoke actions in the Controller from the
     View.
</p>

<p>
    To illustrate this point we can look at the following figure:

    <img src="images/dev_mvvm.png" alt="MVVM pattern overview"
    style="width:40%; align:right; margin:15px 0px 15px 15px;"/>
</p>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>The controller asks the repository to get a model, a Customer.</li>
        <li>The controller takes the model it gets and fills the ViewModel with
        data. This is where the IsAlcoholBeveragesVisibl property is set by the
        controller.</li>
        <li>The view is bound to the viewmodel, and changes in the view will
        propagate to the viewmodel and vice versa.</li>
        <li>The controller can also subscribe to changes in the viewmodel. It
        can make decisions and as a result change values on the viewmodel,
        which then propagates to the view.</li>
        <li>The viewmodel can have commands. When a command is fired, the
        controller reacts to the command and takes action, e.g. saves the
        contents of the viewmodel.</li>
        <li>In the case of a save/update, the controller will take information
        from the viewmodel to change/create a new model and add it to the
        repository.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h3>3.2 Command Pattern</h3>
<p>
    The command pattern is at the heart of the MVVM pattern. As mentioned in
    chapter 3.1 a command can be injected into a ViewModel. By way of binding
    we can create a bridge between actions performed on the view, say a click
    on a button, and the controller.
    
</p>


<h3>3.3 Repository + Specification Pattern</h3>
<p>
    In Domain Driven Design it is very popular to use a design pattern called
    the Repository Pattern. This is a pattern for persisting and retreving
    objects, and it is used to hide all implementation details concerning the
    actual technology used for persitance.
</p>

<p>
    The reason we use the repository pattern instead of a reguar Data Access
    Layer (DAL) is to make a clear cut abstraction where we start using terms
    from the domain we are working with. This means that there should be no
    SQL, no paths and no persistence-specific code when you retreive or
    save/update domain objects. This way we can keep code beyond the
    repositories true to the domain. The snippet below shows the IRepository
    interface:

</p>
<pre>
    public interface IRepository<TDomainModel> 
    { 
        IEnumerable<TDomainModel> Get(Specification<TDomainModel> specification); 
    }
</pre>
<p>
    The Get method returns a list of Changesets, based on the specification you
    provide as a parameter (the use of a specification is a pattern in its own
    right, and it is explained in the Specification Pattern chapter). The
    repository hides all the nitty gritty details about where the objects are
    stored, and how they are fetched, all you need to do is to specify what
    objects you would like to be returned.  All objects that needs to retreive
    objects use an IRepository&lt;TDomainModel&gt; to do so. This way we can control
    what source is used to get objects. This is good for testing and also gives
    more control runtime as we can have fall over repositories etc.
</p>

<p>
    We mentioned previously that one point of using repositories is to be able
    to use domain language. This can be seen in the following example:
</p>
<pre>
    repository.Get(new ChangesetsAfterRevisionSpecification(50));
</pre>

<p>
    This example is from the CheckinNotificationController on the client side
    of Smeedee (the Silverlight app). Here the user wants to get all the
    changesets after revision number 50. The alternative DAL way of doing this
    would be to declare a new method on the DAL, for example
    dal.GetChangeSetsAfterRevision(50). This would break the Open-Closed
    principle very badly. The interface itself would have to change. With the
    repository+specification approach we can keep the same interface and just
    introduce a new specification whenever we need to specify something. The
    specification itself will contain the actual code for checking if a
    changeset satisfies the given specification. This means that the repository
    is closed for modification but open for extension by passing different
    specifications.
</p>

<h2>4 Tools/Framework</h2>
<h3>4.1 NHibernate</h3>
<p>
    Smeedee works by taking information out of various systems and aggregating
    it. This information can then be combined with other information and
    presented on a screen. Whenever an integration repository goes out and
    retreives information from a system, say Subversion, the information is
    converted into a Smeedee domain model. This makes it possible for the rest
    of the Smeedee system to treat information from different systems, in the
    same way. For example the information from a version control system, like
    Subversion, Git or Team Foundation System will all be translated by their
    respecitve repositories and given to Smeedee as a domain model called
    Changeset. Now Smeedee will have to store this information somewhere. This
    is where Nhibernate comes into the picture.
</p>

<h4>Mapping</h4>
<p>
    Nhibernate is a Object-Relational-Mapper, ORM for short. NHibernate takes a
    domain model, in the form of a .NET class, and stores instances of this
    class into a relational database. In Smeedee we currently use SQLite as our
    relational database. To achieve this we need to give NHibernate some hints
    as to how things should be stored in the database. This is called a
    mapping, and it is defined in xml files ending with hbm.xml. In Smeedee
    these mappings can be found in the DomainModel project.
</p>

<p>
    So what does a mapping look like? Well, it looks like xml of course! Under
    is a sample Nhibernate mapping taken from the Smeedee codebase.
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
    &lt;hibernate-mapping 
        xmlns="urn:nhibernate-mapping-2.2" 
        assembly="Smeedee.DomainModel" 
        namespace="Smeedee.DomainModel.SourceControl"&gt;
        &lt;class name="Changeset" table="Changeset"&gt;
            &lt;id name="Revision"&gt;
                &lt;generator class="assigned"/&gt;
            &lt;/id&gt;
            &lt;property name="Time"/&gt;
            &lt;property name="Comment"/&gt;
            &lt;component name="Author" class="Author" lazy="false"&gt; 
                &lt;property name="Username"/&gt;
            &lt;/component&gt;
        &lt;/class&gt;
    &lt;/hibernate-mapping&gt;
</pre>

<p>
    This mapping contains alot of information that Nhibernate uses to
    understand what to do when it is told to save a Changeset. For starters,
    the hibernate-mapping element says what assembly and namespace the mapped
    type lives in. It then goes on and defines a class element. In this element
    the actual class name is given, along with the desired tablename. The
    tablename is independant of the class name.  The id element defines the
    property Revision as the primary key for this type. That is, we're telling
    Nhibernate that Revisions are uniqe and can be used a primary key within
    the Changeset table. The generator element tells NHibernate to lay off, we
    want to assign the id ourself. This value comes from the system where the
    Changeset originates, and it is set by the integration repository. The
    property element just tells Nhibernate that the property should be stored
    in the database. The component element is much more interesting!
</p>

<p>
    The Changeset class has a property called Author, whitch is of type Author.
    Nhibernate can automatically "map" basic types like ints, DateTime, string,
    char etc. But when an unknown type is part of an object graph it gets too
    much for Nhibernate to handle on its own. So we're giving Nhibernate some
    help by saying that we would like Author to be stored as a "component" of
    the Changeset. This means that the Author property of Changeset is stored
    in the same table as the Changeset itself, and not in a separate table with
    a foreign key to it. The property element inside the component element
    tells Nhibernate what properties of the Author we would like to store
    "inline" with the Changeset. The Author class only has one property,
    Username, and with this mapping it is stored in its own column in the
    Changeset table.
</p>

<p>
    NHibernate is a very feature rich system, and most of it is out of scope
    for this article. For more information on how to use the more advanced
    feature of NHibernate have a look at the documentation over at 
    <a href="http://nhforge.org/Default.aspx">NHibernate Forge</a>.
</p>

<h3>4.2 MSBuild</h3>
<p>
    MSBuild is Microsoft's own build platform which is a vital part of the .NET
    framework. We use MSBuild build scripts for continuous integration and for
    invoking WiX to make install kits. Build scripts can be run manually from a
    command prompt using the MSBuild.exe program. You'll find the .NET4 version
    in "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0" or similar.
</p>

<h4>Build script maintenance</h4>
<p>
    If you make any new projects and want them to build along with the rest of
    Smeedee when the build scripts are executed, just add them to the
    Smeedee.sln solution and they will be automatically included in the build
    process.
</p>

<p>
    Test projects however are a bit different, to include these projects to be
    automatically executed by the NUnit testrunner, just add them to the
    Smeedee.TestProjects.msbuild file in the same manner as the existing test
    projects.
</p>

<h3>4.2 Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF)</h3>
<p>
    Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) is a highly flexible framework for
    connecting application components together. Its just short of pure magic
    and proper use of it makes adding new functionality to your application (at
    any point in your development stage) tremendously less painful than it
    otherwise would have been. To show you just how magic MEF really is we give
    you the following example:
</p>

<p>
    Picture that we have two classes, class A and class B. We now want to have
    a field reference to class A in class B. Traditionally one instance a A and
    B class and then use a "B.a = a;" or something like that via a 3. party
    code (like for instance the main method). With MEF you get a quite
    different approach. If you define a [Export()] attribute on class A (like
    example below)
</p>

<pre>
    Export(typeof(A))
    class A { ... }

    class B:
    Unknown macro: { [Import(typeof(A))] public A a; }
</pre>



<h2>5 Solution overview</h2>
<p>
    This section will go through most of our solution file and is aimed at
    giving you a better understanding of where components are and were they
    should be placed. Its only logical that we start at the beginning, so this
    is what you see when you open our main solution file:
</p>

<h3>5.1 BuildScripts</h3>
<p>
    In this folder we keep our build scripts, which are mainly used for
    Continuous Integration (CI) and generating install kits with Wix.
</p>

<h3>5.2 Client</h3>
<p>
    This folder houses all the components that belong to our client, excluded
    the general domain concepts which are kept in the DomainModel folder (Ref.
    6.5). Widgets have their own folders, with one folder possibly containing
    more than one Widget. There isn't any official convention for widget
    placement, although all Widgets are at present date categorized by either
    functionality or which data they require access to.
</p>

<p>
    The Framework projects are a good example of the general project structure
    we use in Smeedee. We have one class library project, one test project
    (marked "Tests") and one Silverlight project (marked "SL"). General client
    logic and functionality should be placed in the Client.Framework project.
    For example classes like type converters for Silverlight bindings are
    placed here then mirrored by way of linking into the Framework.SL project.
    This is done because Silverlight projects can only reference other
    Silverlight projects. Widgets access data by way of repository classes.
    These again are wrapper classes for a specific web service.
</p>

<p>
    As mentioned in chapter 1.2 the collected data is exposed through web
    services running on the server. These services references are placed in the
    "Framework.SL" project and all future services should also be added here.
</p>

<h3>5.3 Common</h3>
<p>
    This is a folder for components that are common for all the parts of
    Smeedee. Currently it only holds a Guard class.
</p>

<h3>5.5 DomainModel</h3>
<p>
    The DomainModel folder is fairly self explanatory. this is where we place
    general concepts and interfaces for all the different components of
    Smeedee.
</p>

<p>
    As with integration code, all domain concepts that are related to a
    specific subject matter are placed in the same folder. These are mirrored
    into the ".SL" project for the same reasons as explained in chapter 6.2.   
</p>


<h3>5.6 Integration</h3>
<p>
    The integration folder contains the logic required by many of the tasks to
    talk to third party systems. More specifically it contains helper classes
    that amount to various repositories. These repositories work as wrappers
    for said logic and is again used by the corresponding Task. We use the
    same organizational theme here as with the other project, meaning logic is
    categorized by subject matter and placed in related folders.
</p>

<h3>5.7 Server</h3>
<p>
    The name "Server" might be a bit misleading because this folder will
    (after compilation) contain the XAP (Silverlight-based application package)
    client file. It also contains the webpage in which the Silverlight
    application is hosted.
</p>

<p>
    Despite the fact mentioned above the term "Server" is still applicable.
    This is because the web services that fetch data from the database is also
    defined here. These services are the same services that we reference client
    side (see 5.2 for details). This means that when you run the solution from
    Visual Studio the "ASP.NET Development Server" automagically creates
    instances of these services which in fact is our whole server architecture.
    When you run a install kit the services will be installed on the local IIS
    server. So in short the only thing you have to do when creating a new
    server component is to create a new service and corresponding test suite
    and then reference it in the "APD.Client.Framework.SL" project (Ref. 5.2).
</p>


<h3>5.8 Installer</h3>
<p>
    The installer solution contains a WiX project along with some resources
    such as a copy of the "GNU Lesser General Public License" and media files
    used by the installer. To add components and actions to the Installer
    package, have a look at product.wxs.
